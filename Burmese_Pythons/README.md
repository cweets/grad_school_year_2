Burmese Pythons (_Python molurus bivittatus_) are an invasive species in the Greater Everglades Ecosystem of Florida USA. These generalist predators were likely first introduced in ~1995, 
and their population is expected to have grown exponentially since then, though measuring population dynamics is difficult. 

In this project, my partner John Katial and I created models to estimate the current population of these pythons and understand their affect on native species in the ecosystem.
