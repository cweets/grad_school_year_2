These are projects that I did in Dr. Bansal's Population and Disease Modeling Class in Fall 2024. In this repo, you will find my forays into learning Python - yes, all while studying (burmese) pythons! 

üêç During the population ecology portion of the course, I became especially interested the invasive Burmese Python population in the Greater Everglades Ecosystem. Current policy solutions to control the population include hiring contractors to hunt and eliminate the invasive species - even holding [annual contests](https://flpythonchallenge.org/) to determine which individuals eliminated the most snakes. Interested in this approach, I spent the first half of the semester studying the effects of these programs and estimating the current population of Burmese Pythons in the ecosystem based on available data. Visit the [Burmese_Pythons](https://github.com/cweets/grad_school_year_2/tree/main/Burmese_Pythons) repo to see what I found!
