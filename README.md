These are projects that I did in Dr. Bansal's Population and Disease Modeling Class in Fall 2024. In this repo, you will find my forays into learning Python! 

üêç During the population ecology portion of the course, I became especially interested the invasive Burmese Python population in the Greater Everglades Ecosystem. 
Current policy solutions to control the population include hiring contractors to hunt and eliminate the invasive species - even holding annual contests to determine which individuals eliminated the most snakes (https://flpythonchallenge.org/).
Interested in this approach, I spent the first half of the semester studying the effects of these programs and estimating the current population of Burmese Pythons in the ecosystem based on available data.
